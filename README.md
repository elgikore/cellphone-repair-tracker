# How to install
1. Make sure you have [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/3.1) or higher (since it uses C# 8.0).
2. Click the latest version on the Releases section and download the source code. Alternatively, click the green code button and download as a ZIP (or you can clone it).
3. Open your favorite code editor of your choice (Visual Studio is more recommended than VS Code)
4. Open the solution file and then run (Visual Studio) or open the folder of the project and then run the MainWindow.xaml.cs file (VS Code and other code editors)
   * You can also launch it from the terminal but make sure you use Roslyn as the [compiler](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31875825/how-to-run-roslyn-instead-csc-exe-from-command-line).
6. Enjoy!

> [!WARNING]
> [_For Visual Studio users_] If there's an error saying "One or more projects in the solution were not correctly loaded", click OK, and it should still work, app and everything.
